## Lean theorem prover

### About

Taken from the [Lean website](https://leanprover.github.io/about/):

*Lean is a functional programming language that makes it easy to write correct and maintainable code. You can also use Lean as an interactive theorem prover. Lean programming primarily involves defining types and functions. This allows your focus to remain on the problem domain and manipulating its data, rather than the details of programming*

This repo contains a number of Lean programs (structured as hypotheses and goals), created in order to gain a better and clearer understanding of how proofs work.

The `./samples` directory contains a number of simple proofs with comments and explanations.

### Installation and usage

See [Setting Up Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/setup.html) for a detailed guide on how to get started in writing and executing Lean programs. Alternatively, try out an online [WebAssembly version](https://leanprover-community.github.io/lean-web-editor/) of Lean.
